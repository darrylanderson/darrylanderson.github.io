I've been building software products for 20+ years, across multiple domains including healthcare (genomics, clinical trials, medical records), transportation, knowledge management, and telecom.

From a technology perspective, I'm passionate about cloud architecture, continuous delivery, devops culture, and security. I believe that architecture should support the business, and that common architectural 'ilities' such as reliability, scalability, maintainability, security, and extensibility are best achieved through cloud delivery models.
